# VR-Room
 This was my school project while I was in highschool learning the basics.
 
I was really into Spider-Man at the time(still am) and wanted to make a Spider-Man VR game.

I worked on this for months but made the mistake of using it as an assignment for a grade so I had to implement many things that dont fit with the vibe of the game or have any use in the future.

I currently have stopped development on this project but hope to come back to it in the future when I am more experienced and can fix/ improve on many aspects of the game!
